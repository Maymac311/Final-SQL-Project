Here are my answers to the questions in the final SQL project of the course

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, customerID, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country != 'USA';

#2. Show only the customers from Brazil

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoice.InvoiceID, invoice.InvoiceDate, invoice.BillingCountry

INNER JOIN chinook.customers AS customers

WHERE invoice.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the employees who are Sales Support Agents

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT empl.FirstName, empl.LastName, inv.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.Employees AS empl
JOIN chinook.Customers AS cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = empl.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON inv.CustomerID = cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT empl.LastName, empl.FirstName, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.Total
FROM chinook.employees AS empl
JOIN chinook.Customers AS cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = empl.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices AS inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales of 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
Where InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.

SELECT track.Name, invoice.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items AS invoice
JOIN chinook.Tracks AS track
ON invoice.TrackId = track.TrackId

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item.

SELECT track.Name, track.Composer, invoice.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items AS invoice 
JOIN chinook.Tracks AS track 
ON invoice.TrackId = track.TrackId

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
